# K-map_calculator_for_synchronous_counter
This is my first project.
Why I work on this project? I learn a subject that called 'Digital Systems and Microprocessors' and my teacher arrange test about Synchronous Counter which need to use 2-3 operation before you can design the circuit. Teacher will give us sequence of 6 numbers (ex. 0-1-2-3-4-5) and give us 30 minutes to design the circuit that display numbers one by one as given. It's a bit tight for me. And for that reason I work on this project to decrease time that I need to use to calculate K-map before design the circuit.
How does it work?
